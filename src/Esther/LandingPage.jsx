            Every day, thousands of Nigerians need blood to survive accidents,
            surgeries, and medical conditions. <br /> Yet, blood shortages
            remain a challenge. LifeLink connects willing donors to hospitals
            and blood <br /> banks, making it easier to save lives while
            ensuring you get rewarded for your generosity.
